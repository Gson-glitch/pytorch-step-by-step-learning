    "## What's Dependency Injection (DI)\n",
    "Dependency Injection is a way of giving an object (like a class) the things it needs from the outside, instead of creating them itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need it?**\n",
    "- Without DI your code becomes tangled, hard to test, and hard to change.\n",
    "- With DI your code is cleaner, easier to test, and an easy way to swap implementations"

    "**The problem**\n",
    "- We are creating the `Engine()` dependency from inside the class. Now what happens if I wanna test with a different engine, say `ElectricEngine`, I'll have to modify the `Car` class.\n",
    "- Well, you can say that why not pass engine as a parameter for the `__init__` method like `__init__(self, engine: Engine)`? Well, that's DI at it's very simplest level.\n",
    "- This is acceptable but then as dependencies grow, the code becomes messy. Imagine `Engine` also has another dependency `FuelType` and `Car` has other dependencies like `Sensors`, `GPS`, `ParkingCamera`? See, the code gets ugly with all these chained dependencies because you'll literally have to do something like: `__init__(self, engine: Engine(fuel_type: FuelType), sensors: Sensors, gps: GPS, parking_camera: ParkingCamera)`"
